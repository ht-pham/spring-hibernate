## Project 4: The First Java Web App
### Summary
Finally, the first Java web app is built with Spring framework libraries. The web app has two hyperlink links for two mini projects. The two links are used to redirect the users to two simple webapp forms which are built with a basic frontend design using .JSP files with CSS, JavaScript files and a basic backend configuration with Java classes with Spring framework's libraries.
### Directory Explained
Folder 'src': where all Java classes including View Controllers and Model classes locate.
<br>
Folder 'web': where all files for frontend design locates plus two configuration .xml files (one for Spring app, other for web service)
### Tools
1. The best JDK version to run the project: JDK 8 or JDK 11. 
2. The Spring framework version to run project: either version 5.3.9 (as latest when this project is uploaded) or any older version.
3. Last but not least (i.e. required): Apache Tomcat version 9.0 (Newer version cannot support this application).
### How to run the project
Deploy your new WAR file by copying it to <tomcat-install-directory>\webapps. Once deployment is completed, a folder which has the same name as your WAR file will be created. To visit your web app, go to: http://localhost:8080/<web-app-name\>/
