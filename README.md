# Spring & Hibernate for Beginner
### Introduction
This repository is created to keep track of the demo projects I've learned and done on Udemy course's [Spring & Hibernate for Beginners (including Spring Boot)](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/?src=sac&kw=spring+%26+hiber).
### Projects
Each folder is one project. 
1. spring-demo-one: the first project implements the very basic operation of Java programming (classes implementing interfaces) with XML configuration file to generate Spring Beans for demo purposes.
2. spring-demo-annotations: the second project implements the same functionality as the project #1, but it uses Spring Annotations instead of manipulating XML file.
3. spring-practice-ioc-di: the third project implements some more advanced topics: inversion of control, dependency injections by using Configuration class instead of XML. 
4. spring-mvc-demo: the fourth project is the first Spring MVC project which is a web application. Currently, it has two web forms/"mini-projects" done in the web app. Extra software installed for the project: Apache Tomcat **9.0** version to set as the server. 
5. hibernate-demo: the fifth project is a Hibernate project which implements basic CRUD operations through the established communication with the local host's database on MySQL. To set up the database and user accounts for database access, we used MySQLWorkBench.
5. hibernate-employee: Similar to project #5, this is a practice project for Hibernate. The sixth project is a Hibernate project which implements basic CRUD operations through the established communication with the local host's database on MySQL. To set up the database and user accounts for database access, we used MySQLWorkBench.
### Tools/Software
Tools/Skills that I've learned to use in the course: Java, Apache Tomcat, basic frontend design (HTML syntax for .JSP files, CSS & JavaScript for UI purpose), Spring framework including SpringMVC, Hibernate (Hibernate ORM and Validator), MySQL and MySQL Workbench.
